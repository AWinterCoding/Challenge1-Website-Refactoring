# Challenge1-Website-Refactoring

First Assignment for Webdev - Refactor a website to make it more accessible

## Project Description

Refactor a website to make it seo optimized and readable with comments.

## How to Install and Run the Project

For this website you can pull off of github and simply open the index.html while inside of the file folder.
Alternatively I have also hosted the website off of github as a working example.

## How to Use the Project

This is an html page, so to utilize this project you can view it while having the file structure initially pulled down from the repo.
Alternatively, if you edit, the included comments should guide you through the structure of the page.
